# EazyFinderProject
Project in C done based on the Greedy Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path) <br>

<h2>Abstract:</h2><br>
This project contains a graph that has places of a city that are connected by the local bus facility, cabs, bike, auto or metro, as nodes and, if they are connected by that vehicle then an edge will be present b/w them with the distance, time, cost as the edge weight and also each vehicle with different costs. If the user enters the starting point and destination locations, if they are connected, the edge weight will be shown i;e distance, time and cost. So the entire project runs by giving the user the mode of transportation possible from start to destination in the best way possible <br>
