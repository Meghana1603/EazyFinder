# EazyFinderProject
Project in C done based on the Greedy Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path) <br>
<strong>THE PROJECT WILL BE UPOADED SOON</strong>

<h2>Abstract:</h2><br>
This project contains a graph that has places of a city that are connected by the local bus facility, cabs, bike, etc., as nodes and, if they are connected by that vehicle then an
edge will be present b/w them with the distance, time, cost as the edge weight and also each vehicle with different costs. If the user enters the starting point and destination
locations, if they are connected, the edge weight will be shown i;e distance, time and cost. If they are not connected, the place that is nearest(using the single source shortest
path algo) to the destination and connected to starting point will be shown and if their is any mode of transport possible from that location to the destination such as Cycling,
Metro Service or any other will be shown with the distance, time and cost approximately that would take from their to the destination. So the entire project runs by giving the
user the mode of transportation possible from start to destination. <br>
