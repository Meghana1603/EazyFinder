# EazyFinderProject
Project in C done based on the Greedy Algorithm (Single Source Shortest Path) <br>

<h2>Abstract:</h2><br>
This project contains a graph that has places of a city that are connected by the local bus facility, cabs, bike, etc., as nodes and, if they are connected by that vehicle then an
edge will be present b/w them with the distance, time, cost as the edge weight and also each vehicle with different costs. If the user enters the starting point and destination
locations, if they are connected, the edge weight will be shown i;e distance, time and cost. If they are not connected, the place that is nearest(using the single source shortest
path algo) to the destination and connected to starting point will be shown and if their is any mode of transport possible from that location to the destination such as Cycling,
Metro Service or any other will be shown with the distance, time and cost approximately that would take from their to the destination. So the entire project runs by giving the
user the mode of transportation possible from start to destination. <br>
<strong><h4>Our Main Features are:</h4></strong>
1) Login and Signup that maintains Privacy <br>
2) Displaying the map <br>
3) If wrong locations or the locations where our service is not available are given appropriate locations (source or destination) are prompted again <br>
4) The Path from source to destination with less distance is shown to the user also the distance is shown <br>
5) Providing different modes of transportation <br>
6) Checking Traffic and providing different modes of transportation for a route if needed <br>
7) Checking Availability of Vehicles based on the booking time <br>
8) If the service is booked before or after the start time or end time respectively then extra charges will be applied <br>
9) Also bill is generated that shows mode of transport from one place to other place the place names, price of travel based on the mode of transport, and distance that includes extra costs if any <br>
10) Providing our services for different locations/ cities/ states <br>
